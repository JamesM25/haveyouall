This application is a simple forum website for the topic of games. We have a homepage where users are able to 
view formums and some live data but do not have access to post of make changes until they are logged in. There is 
functionality of a sign up / login page with incorperating a database.

* Routes all URLs and leverages a templating language using the Fat-Free framework.
* Has a clearly defined database layer using PDO and prepared statements.
* Data can be added and viewed.
* Has a history of commits from both team members to a Git repository. Commits are clearly commented.
* Uses OOP, and utilizes multiple classes, including at least one inheritance relationship.
* Contains full Docblocks for all PHP files and follows PEAR standards.
* Has full validation on the server side through PHP.
* All code is clean, clear, and well-commented. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) is practiced.

Throughout this project, we were able to maintain MVC principles by separating database side of the project from 
the rest and keeping it somehwhat secure. We also made use of the fat free framework by adapting to the principles 
we were taught throughout the quarter. One of the bigger things from this lsit was the templeting and routing protion.
We were able to implement this which allows for proffesionalism and cleanliness of code and files. Git version conmtrol
assisted in this as well. In this project, data can be viewed in terms of post, replies, likes, etc. It cna also be
added by the user creating a post, leaving comments, likes, etc. Git was used in this project and we were both able 
to post and use it without serious conflicts. In this project we were able to use OOP in terms of the posts that we
recieve. Inheritance was used for our login portions for gathering user info and storing. We also tried to follow PEAR
standards to keep everything in check and legible / understandable for developers in terms of PHP legibility and format.
We were able to acomplish validation through PHP for our forms and login. We applied this as we learned validation in
class and it all seems to work well. Code is commented well but there may still be some slight changes.
